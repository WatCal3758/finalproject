Final Project of Code Apprentice


Due to work conflicts, traveling plans, I was not able to ask questions of my mentor tonight to answer
my final questions. Therefore my project is lacking in several areas. I would be happy to complete it after the deadline but Paul Drake told me to submit as is. I felt the video would be useless as the main problem with my project was the links.
Sorry about the inconvience. I really enjoyed this program!
